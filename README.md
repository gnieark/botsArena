# Still in dev
To do:
- English translation
- Develop others arenas (thinking about Connect Four, tron, and maybe one day chess)
- Fixes
- Show bot's description
- Page for bot's owners (manage description url etc...)

# Contribute
You are welcome, Make pull requests on branch dev. Im available on twitter [@gnieark](https://twitter.com/gnieark) in order to talk

# install it
I'd better like you to help me to improve [bot's Arena](https://botsarena.tinad.fr/), and you to make your own bots to play challenges. It would be more funny having lot of bots in one arena rather than lot of arenas.
